# firstGitProject
This is my last commit for Git home work. I hope I did all right and enough. Although there were some typos and other mistakes and the whole work may seem messy (sorry for this, but I don't really have time to redo it) I suppose this is not a very big problem. I think I improved  my Git usage skills. :)
